### 1. Professional Self Assessment

I have been taking part in the Computer Science program since 2019, right after I graduated from High School. I spent time before moving into the program working within a collaborative environment to design, fabricate, and launch two rockets. Taking that work into the Computer Science program allowed me to have a better understanding of how to participate within the team setting in a more meaningful way that helped to remain productive and efficient. Throughout the program I have learned how to interpret user needs into active plans for development. I have an understanding of how to properly test and debug code to ensure that detrimental failures are not present, as well as how to catch defects early to save on development costs. Most of all, I have learned how to problem solve within the program, which makes me an asset as I can effectively communicate issues as well as produce solutions that align with client needs. 

Within the Computer Science program, I have dedicated a great deal of time working with data structures, algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security. With a team I developed the basis for a fantasy setting goal and incentive oriented program that would allow users to collect items of value in an application as the users meet the goals they set themselves within the program. Using our knowledge of data structures to keep our processes organized as well as algorithmic principles to demonstrate our understanding of how to optimize those processes helped to successfully create the basis for the program. I have also worked within a full stack environment to create a travelling website that contained a database, front facing user interface, and at least one security feature to ensure that information was protected. I learned how to keep in mind restrictions set by elements within the UI/UX as well as how to work around those restrictions to create a program that met the necessary requirements. I also spent time learning to implement a database that contained the information for a trip that is to be displayed on the website. This includes CRUD implementation so information within the database could be interacted with. These processes were then protected by a basic username and password system that had permissions based on the user that was logging in at the time. The project also focused heavily on interpreting user needs, as well as how to deal with user needs changing amidst the development process. 

I have spent the past two months enhancing one artifact in line with three categories. Software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and lastly databases. Each enhancement is built together to achieve the 5 outcomes listed below. The artifact I chose to work with as the basis for the enhancements is a mobile weight tracking application that was initially created during my time on the CS 360 course. I have taken the time to rebuild the application from scratch, changing the layout system from a relative layout to a constraint layout. I have also updated the navigation system for the application and aligned the UI/UX with user needs. Additional features such as a calorie screen have also been added alongside necessary database tables. The display for userâ€™s weight information has also been updated to a line graph to visually demonstrate the progress of the changes in weight. Lastly, the username/password security system also holds user specific information so multiple users can log into the application and see their specific information. Each addition has been made to enhance the application to overcome the shortcomings of the initial version.

### 5. Enhancement Narrative

**Artifact introduction**

I originally developed the weight tracking application for my CS 360 final project. Development for the project began and ended a little over two months ago. The initial version of the application before the enhancement process was meant to have a basic login interface, a screen to add, delete, and update weight information, as well as a grid view that would display the input weight information. Before adding enhancements there were several missing or broken features. There was also no display for the goal value, and the database was made up of one table. The program was basic, lacking in good algorithmic principles and structure. 

I chose this artifact for enhancements because of the diversity of skills required to complete development of the application. The weight tracking application also provided the opportunity to meet all five course outcomes across the three categories of enhancements. My initial program provided a challenge with problems that could be solved, and a basis for growth in software development through the addition of new or improved features. 

**Course Outcomes**

*I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enabled diverse audiences to support organization decision making in the field of computer science* by keeping up to date with my professor on any feedback provided and clarifying and misunderstandings about the provided feedback. I also made sure to keep my professor up to date through emails and journals to ensure that a collaborative aspect of the enhancement process was upheld. I proved I was able to document my process and effectively communicate important information through emails. I also wrote descriptive inline comments and headers within the code. This was also accomplished by ensuring that my code was readable by following proper standards as well as using proper naming conventions for each variable to avoid any confusion within the code itself. If my program were to be submitted for development within a team environment, I would be able to provide all the necessary documentation for the team to immediately begin work on the code.

I also created a program that followed at least two UI/UX best practices so multiple users could easily pick up the application I enhanced and developed as a useful tool. I had a focus on simplicity, so I avoided any unnecessary interactions on the screen that may distract the user. I kept the speed of the application in mind, while also streamlining the navigation process. The application is easily traversable, and there is very little to no noticeable load times between the main features of the application. I also kept in mind mobile responsiveness, whenever the user interacts with one of the buttons, a toast message tells the user whether their process was successful, so it never feels like a button does nothing. I also followed feedback from my professor for the UI/UX and had a focus on the user needs for keeping track of weight and calories. 

*I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts* by keeping all necessary documentation in line with the development process. I created a plan and revised the plan to account for insufficient detail in the enhancement process, or if changes came up during the development cycle. I wrote pseudocode for the planned enhancements to provide an idea for the changes that were going to be made. I adhered to the provided feedback to ensure that the quality of my enhancements was up to the proper standards while also editing my documentation to be in line with the updated requirements. I added Java file headers that provided necessary information such as an application description, version, author, date, and file description. I also included proper function documentation with function comments that described the purpose, parameters, and return values. I have also created an informal video code review that went over the code orally alongside the planned enhancements for the code. Lastly, I have written multiple narratives, a professional self-reflection, and placed all the necessary documentation in an easily accessible git pages website. 

*I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices* by improving the efficiency of the applications processes while also keeping in mind additional features that needed to be implemented. To improve the time complexity of the application, I changed the traversal process for the code entirely. Instead of activating a new activity by clicking a button at the top or bottom of each screen, I set up the program to only contain two activities. One of which would control the screen changes between four fragments. The program took significantly less time to load and use as each fragment could be quickly accessed using the bottom navigation bar. I changed the display for the weight information to a line graph to better display the userâ€™s progress. To implement the graph properly, I had to consider what kind of information could be displayed as well as what information might break the display. I solved these issues with string to integer conversions, adding a starter data point to avoid null pointer exceptions, changed display parameters to only show the user input information, and used a max value query to ensure that deleting or updating an item in the program would not cause failures. 

With the addition of the calorie screen, I had to create a new set of CRUD functions that would take in the correct parameters to interact with the database. All the database functions were located within the database controller, which was then initiated in the sign in activity and the three of the four fragments that required interactions with the database controller. With the addition of the CRUD functions for calories, it was important to keep track of whether the code was efficient. I also made sure that no more than one row per account could be added to the phone and goal tables within the database. This would prevent failures related to user information conflicting with too many data sets. This also meant proper opening and closure of variables that accessed database information to avoid data leeks. In turn, the time complexity and space complexity of the program was maintained. 

*I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry specific goals by implementing solutions that followed the enhancement requirements while making use of the features provided* by android studio during the development process. I used my skills with java as well as object-oriented programming to create a program that followed the enhancement plan laid out at the beginning of the term. I made use of XML and Java to update the application accordingly. I took the time to access the Gradle properties as well as manifest files to add permissions or install processes required to create the line graph and gain access to SMS permissions. A good number of if-else checks were used to keep track of information going in and coming out. I encountered errors if the user account being accessed contained no information for the line graph to process, so I created a process for the datapoint array to be checked so the line graph would not create a failure. I also used these checks to catch errors within the process, and inform the user if information was input incorrectly, or if what the user was attempting to input was not within the scope of the application. 

The computing practices demonstrated in the artifact enhancement were all used to attain the goal of following the enhancement plan set out at the beginning of the course. I created an application that takes in user information, checks if the account exists, allows the user to create an account with a unique username, and keeps track of which user is accessing the application. I followed my plan to add additional or improved features to create a satisfactory product that met my preset industry specific goals. 

*I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources* by ensuring that the sign in features of the application dictated what information could be accessed from the database as well as providing the information for only the user that is currently logged in. If a user tries to login and the account does not exist, the application will prevent them from accessing information and remain on the login screen. If the user wishes to create an account, then they must provide a unique username and a password for the application to store in the account table of the database. Each account contains a primary key. This primary key alongside each other tableâ€™s foreign key is what dictates which userâ€™s information is being accessed. If I am logged in as user one, I cannot access user twoâ€™s data. To ensure the safety of the user, in the notifications fragment, the user must input their phone number and grant the program access to SMS permissions. If the user does not grant permissions, the program will function as usual. If the user does allow SMS, then the user will be provided updates on whether they have reached their input weight goal if it exists. I have also kept up with coding standards to ensure that no malicious actors could access user information due to flaws within the code. Throughout my time on this project, I have learned to keep security in mind as user protection comes first and foremost. 

**Reflection**

I learned a lot about mobile application development throughout my time enhancing this artifact. I had to have a concrete focus on both the front end and back-end processes of the application as well as how they interacted to create a satisfactory product. There were issues with the initial stages of the application as I did not have experience with SQLite, but once I understood there were a lot of similarities with MySQL and NoSQL syntax, I was able to come up with solutions as I went along. The other biggest challenge was the line graph. It caused a lot of problems when I first implemented it, and I would have to manually add delete functions to stop the application from crashing when the line graph tried to display incorrect information. I added some checks as well as an initial graph value and display parameters that slowly ironed out the issues as time went on. Now the graph displays weight information nicely, and the CRUD functions of the weight tracking do not break the display. 

Android studio was an interesting beast to handle. There were a lot of times where it was slow or wouldnâ€™t register changes to the code without a full IDE restart. I also had to go into my PCâ€™s BIOS to change a setting for the android simulator to work properly. Thereâ€™s an incompatibility with the default settings of my AMD processor compared to the default settings of an Intel processor. 

I focused on implementing my professorâ€™s feedback on my enhancement plan initially, creating a plan that was a lot more detailed to ensure my success throughout the course. For each artifact milestone I also kept track of the feedback about my comments, noting what I was missing or the language I was using in the written narratives. I communicated errors or shortcomings I was aware of and took in the feedback from my professor to fix those errors accordingly. 

I spent a lot of time organizing my artifact, so my development process was efficient as I implemented the different enhancements. Rebuilding the code from scratch was the way to go, I was able to reorganize everything a lot easier. I added the bottom navigation bar to improve the traversal process and improve the time complexity while the application was in use as well. I removed the unnecessary activities and replaced them with fragments. The same goes for the unnecessary constructor classes I create for weight and calorie data, they were completed removed as they ended up not being needed. Also improving the CRUD functions and keeping in mind opening and closure of variables that accessed the database helped to improve time complexity as well.

A lot of the additions were majorly improving the features that didnâ€™t really work in my initial artifact. For example, the grid view did not display weight information properly, and the login was hard coded, there was no database compatibility at all initially. The change from a grid view to a line graph was also a big one as it changed how the user would visually interact with their information. Same with the SMS permissions so users could be notified if they reached their weight goal. The other big change was the addition of the calorie screen, which added an entirely new layer of code that needed to be implemented so the application could become more of a multi-tool when it came to weight tracking. Being able to see caloric intake is important, especially if youâ€™re trying to keep track of it. The UI/UX best practices are important. I made sure to keep in line with at least two if not all the best practices so that my application was as user friendly as I could make it at my current skillset.

There were also a bunch of smaller changes, like where the messaging function was located so it could be accessed by the rest of the fragments easier. Conglomerating all the additional functions in the database controller as each one required direct access to the database tables to interact with the information. Also finally just making sure everything looks professional and was easily understandable by using comments and variable naming conventions. I made sure there was no confusion about what variables were for what as well as what functions did or what each Java file oversaw handling.

I believe I fully met all the course outcomes as I listed above this reflection. I focused my efforts on meeting my enhancement goals while also keeping them in line with course outcomes. Each enhancement was developed with the purpose of meeting these outcomes and demonstrating my skills in software development that I have gained over my time in the Computer Science program.
