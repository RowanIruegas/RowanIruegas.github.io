### 1. Professional Self Assessment

I have been taking part in the Computer Science program since 2019, right after I graduated from High School. I spent time before moving into the program working within a collaborative environment to design, fabricate, and launch two rockets. Taking that work into the Computer Science program allowed me to have a better understanding of how to participate within the team setting in a more meaningful way that helped to remain productive and efficient. Throughout the program I have learned how to interpret user needs into active plans for development. I have an understanding of how to properly test and debug code to ensure that detrimental failures are not present, as well as how to catch defects early to save on development costs. Most of all, I have learned how to problem solve within the program, which makes me an asset as I can effectively communicate issues as well as produce solutions that align with client needs. 

Within the Computer Science program, I have dedicated a great deal of time working with data structures, algorithms, software engineering, databases, and security. With a team I developed the basis for a fantasy setting goal and incentive oriented program that would allow users to collect items of value in an application as the users meet the goals, they set themselves within the program. Using our knowledge of data structures to keep our processes organized as well as algorithmic principles to demonstrate our understanding of how to optimize those processes helped to successfully create the basis for the program. I have also worked within a full stack environment to create a travelling website that contained a database, front facing user interface, and at least one security feature to ensure that information was protected. I learned how to keep in mind restrictions set by elements within the UI/UX as well as how to work around those restrictions to create a program that met the necessary requirements. I also spent time learning to implement a database that contained the information for a trip that is to be displayed on the website. This includes CRUD implementation so information within the database could be interacted with. These processes were then protected by a basic username and password system that had permissions based on the user that was logging in at the time. The project also focused heavily on interpreting user needs, as well as how to deal with user needs changing amidst the development process. 

I have spent the past two months enhancing one artifact in line with three categories. Software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and lastly databases. Each enhancement is built together to achieve the 5 outcomes listed below. The artifact I chose to work with as the basis for the enhancements is a mobile weight tracking application that was initially created during my time on the CS 360 course. I have taken the time to rebuild the application from scratch, changing the layout system from a relative layout to a constraint layout. I have also updated the navigation system for the application and aligned the UI/UX with user needs. Additional features such as a calorie screen have also been added alongside necessary database tables. The display for userâ€™s weight information has also been updated to a line graph to visually demonstrate the progress of the changes in weight. Lastly, the username/password security system also holds user specific information so multiple users can log into the application and see their specific information. Each addition has been made to enhance the application to overcome the shortcomings of the initial version.
